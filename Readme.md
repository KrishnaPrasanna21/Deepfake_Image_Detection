# Model Creation
  - You will be able to preprocess the dataset, train a pytorch model of your own, predict on new unseen data using your model.
  
### Note: We Recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  for running the above code.
 ## Libraries
  - os

 ## Preprocessing
  - Load the dataset

 ## Model and train
  - Create a DeepCNN model.
  - Split the data into train and test data
  - Train the model
  - Test the model
  - save the model in .h5 file

 ## Predict 
  - Load the saved .h5 model
  - Predict the output based in trained weights.


  - Trained Models
    - You can just download our [trained models] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IQsKHvps9w8S3a77YKdX6QqLl9-nLUQZ/view?usp=sharing) and run the predict file for prediction.
